# quiz-time

## description

This site is a JavaScript quiz built to test the userâ€™s knowledge about JavaScript and keep track of the total time spent to complete the quiz. Each attempt is logged onto a high score list so the user can see their improvement in time.

This site was made using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create a responsive and dynamic quiz. The site utilizes local storage to transfer information from one html document to another and will keep that information there for future visits to the site.

## Instructions and Usage

No installation required.

Once on the main page the user is presented with a start button and instructions on the quiz scoring system. Once start is clicked the quiz timer will start and each wrong answer deducts 10 seconds from the overall time. once each question has been answered the user is presented with an input for their initials. once entered the user is redirected to the high score page where their last attempt is outlined in gold. if the timer runs out the enter initials screen will also be presented to the user to save their score. In the upper left corner on both sites there is a link to view the high scores or back to the main page. Good luck!
